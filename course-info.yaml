  is a popular yet grim puzzle game. A cruel computer hides a word from you, which
  you try to guess letter by letter. If you fail, you&#39;ll be &ldquo;hanged&rdquo;.
  If you win, you&#39;ll survive. You&rsquo;ve probably played the game at least once
  or twice. Now you can actually create this game yourself!</span></span></p><br/><br/>Learn
